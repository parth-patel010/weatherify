# Weatherify

A modern, responsive weather application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city worldwide.

REQUEST- The project requires refinement and there are several features that can be added, therefore you can contribute to the project and make it more efficient.

## Features

- 🌤️ **Current Weather Display**: Shows temperature, weather conditions, and detailed metrics
- 📅 **5-Day Forecast**: Displays upcoming weather with icons and descriptions
- 🔍 **City Search**: Search for weather in any city with real-time autocomplete suggestions
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean, glassmorphic design with smooth animations
- ⚡ **Real-time Data**: Fetches live weather data from OpenWeatherMap API

## Live Demo

[View the live demo here](https://ashujsrfox.github.io/weatherify/)//Currently not working)

**Note:** GitHub Pages serves static files only. The app expects a small local (or hosted) Node server that proxies OpenWeatherMap so the API key stays on the server. For the public Pages demo to keep working, maintainers need either a deployed proxy (for example Cloudflare Worker, Vercel serverless, or this `server.js` on a host) or a separate demo URL that runs behind that proxy.


It is requested that users go for local development in order to access the app
## Local development

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or newer.
2. From the project root, run `npm install`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` to your [OpenWeatherMap API key](https://openweathermap.org/api).
4. Run `npm start` and open `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in the terminal).

Opening `index.html` directly in the browser (`file://`) will not work for weather requests, because the UI calls same-origin `/api/*` routes that are provided by `server.js`.

### Key rotation (security)

If an API key was ever committed to the frontend, **revoke it in the OpenWeatherMap dashboard** and create a new key. Only store the new key in `.env` (and in your host’s environment variables), never in `script.js` or other tracked client files.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with:
  - Flexbox and Grid layouts
  - CSS animations and transitions
  - Glassmorphism effects
  - Responsive design principles
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core functionality with:
  - Async/await for API calls
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event handling
  - Debounced input for autocomplete

## API Integration

This app uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** for weather data. The browser only talks to same-origin routes:

- **`GET /api/weather`** → OpenWeatherMap current weather (`/data/2.5/weather`)
- **`GET /api/forecast`** → 5-day forecast (`/data/2.5/forecast`)
- **`GET /api/geo`** → Geocoding (`/geo/1.0/direct`) for autocomplete

The server adds `appid` from the `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` environment variable. The key is not shipped in `script.js`.
